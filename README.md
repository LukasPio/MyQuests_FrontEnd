# A front-end to a to-do-list app with some features as:
#### - Login/register system.
#### - Minimalist design with dark mode. 
#### - Change avatar with an url to image.
#### - Responsive layout that works on screens of at least 280 pixels.
#### - Requests to an api that I developed, to more information about this consider visit my repositorie named: 'MyQuests_BackEnd'

* Observation: 
*  You may have to wait 1 or 2 minutes for the back-end to start,
*  because it was hosted using the free tier of a cloud platform. thanks for understanding.
